# Jammming
## Capstone Project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
Jammming is a React web application lets you search for songs, artists, and albums using the Spotify Web API. Songs from the related search results can be added to a new playlist. You can change the name of this playlist and save it to your Spotify account. 

This is my largest Codecademy project so far, covering many features of ReactJS such as static components, passing and managing state, and API requests.
## What I Learned
  - Creating static components
  - Passing props and state between components
  - Methods that update state
  - Requesting search result responses from the API
  - Converting returned responses to JSON
  - Obtaining API access tokens
  - Using promise chains to catch errors
  - Deploying the project using Surge
